<p>The first book I bought on the subject was <code>Get Programming with Go</code> by <a href="https://twitter.com/nathany">Nathan Youngman</a>.</p>

<p>I found this book an excellent introduction to all of the main topics you&rsquo;re likely to encounter in Go as a beginner. I still find myself using it as a reference as its just so clearly explained and layed out.</p>

<p>Definitely a buy, for any new an aspiring Go programmer.</p>

<p>The third book I bought to supplement my Go learning, was <code>Concurrency in Go</code> by <a href="https://twitter.com/katco_">Katherine Coxâ€“buday</a>.</p>

<p>As Go is a relatively new language, it was built with multicore, multiprocessor systems in mind, and it opens up concurrency to the programmer much easier than other languages do.</p>

<p>I found this book to be an excellent resource for learning in depth about <code>goroutines</code> and <code>channels</code> etc and highly recommended if concurrency is something you want to achieve in your code.</p>
